# PHP-Simple-Form-File-Uploads
This is a simple form I made with the intention of using it for a quiz. I wanted it to be similar to google forms but allow people without a google account to upload files 
(something that google forms does not let you do. It could probably be improved by making the buttons look nicer and adding limiations on file types and file size which I 
could not get working. I used this with OS X Server (MacOS server) with PHP enabled and it worked just fine. Feel free to adapt and use this however you want.
